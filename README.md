# Directory of Google Workspace Developers

## Purpose

There are those who *need* help and then there are those who **can** help.

This space is to help bridge that gap within the Google Workspace (previously, G Suite) Developers community and mostly geared towards users who work within the Apps Script ecosystem.

## Submit your profile

    ```
    * `name` & `slug` are mandatory; link to `image` is mandatory too but you're free to use a default avatar image as well (I used [these ones](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/img_avatar2.png) during testing and development)
        * `slug` needs to start with a `/` and you're free to design the slug based on whatever username you desire (could be the same as your Twitter handle, LinkedIn username etc.)
    * example file: [sourabh-choraria.md](src/people/sourabh-choraria.md)
* Finally, create a pull request
